## Effects of High and Low Temperatures on Sea Level Pressure

read_rds("rds/pressure.rds")

```



## A decrease in sea level pressure can lead to several effects, including:

-Weather patterns: Can bring storms, rain, and windy conditions.

-Agricultural impacts: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, which can affect crops and agricultural production.

-Human health:  Increased respiratory problems, as well as an increased risk of flooding and landslides in some areas.


## An increase in sea level pressure is often associated with high pressure systems and can result in several effects, including:

-Better weather conditions: Clear skies, low winds, and warmer temperatures.

-Agricultural impacts: Temperature and precipitation patterns, potentially affecting crop growth and agricultural production.

-Human health: Improved air quality, with fewer pollutants being transported from the ground to the atmosphere.
