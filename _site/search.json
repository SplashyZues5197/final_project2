    "text": "In conclusion, this data science project has shed light on the critical issue of climate change and the impact it has on our planet. Through our analysis, we have found that there is a clear need for immediate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of global warming. I have also shown how data science can be used to gain insights into climate change patterns and provide meaningful solutions to the problem."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Climate change is having a significant impact on the world, with the most notable effects being seen in rising temperatures, sea level rise, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent and intense weather events. To investigate the impacts,I pulled data from big organizations like NASA, NOAA, and also kaggle like Sea Level Changes, CO2 emissions, and more useful stuff to find the trends in the data. For a century, the global mean sea level has been rising and showing a upward trend."

    "text": "CO2 concentration in Ocean Bodies\n\n\n\n\n\nOcean acidification: As CO2 dissolves in seawater, it reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the water. This process is known as ocean acidification. Lower pH levels can make it more difficult for marine organisms, such as corals, mollusks, and some plankton, to build and maintain their shells and skeletons, which can have cascading effects throughout the food web."
